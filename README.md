### Hosted Project Link
https://github.com/hibakeyath/Hackathon.git


### Project Description
Skill Swap is a web platform UI where users can teach their skills to others and earn badges/credits. Learners can access skills for free a limited number of times and later use earned credits to continue learning.

### The Problem statement
Many people have valuable skills but lack a simple platform to teach and learn from peers, and learners often struggle to access courses without paying.

### The Solution
We created a front-end prototype where:

Users can register and showcase their skills to teach

Learners can explore skills, use free credits to learn, and earn credits to continue learning

A badge system motivates teaching and learning activity.
